When two people on a remote Pacific island saw a small boat washed up on the beach, they decided to take a closer look. Inside the boat, they found a very thin man with long hair and a beard, who said he drifted for 16 months after leaving Mexico, more than 12,500km away.
The man, who was wearing only underpants, told his rescuers that he drifted in the 7.3-metre boat since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A friend died at sea several months before, he said.
His health isnt good, but hes getting better, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on Ebon Island, one of the Marshall Islands. The man said his name was Jos Ivan. He said he survived by catching turtles and birds. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. The boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time, Fjeldstad said.
According to Fjeldstad, the people who found the man took him to a nearby island  which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet  to meet the mayor. The mayor contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. People at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and that the man will probably go to the capital.
Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him, said Fjeldstad. He also said that the man had a basic health check and had low blood pressure but no serious problems and was able to walk. Were giving him a lot of water and hes getting stronger.
Fraser Christian, who teaches people how to survive at sea, said that if the mans story was true, it would be amazing but not unique. It was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, because they will come close to a small boat to shelter underneath it. Christian advises people who have to eat turtles to start with their eyes  lots of fluid  then drink the blood.
The main dangers for castaways are cold and a lack of drinking water. The basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days, so you cant collect rainwater, you will die. Also, some people are more able to survive than others.
Stories of survival in the Pacific Ocean are not rare. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were found drifting near the Marshall Islands, also in a small boat. They said they survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he wasnt sure about the latest story. It just doesnt sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely.
