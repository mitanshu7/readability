A long time ago, cinema audiences were taken to a galaxy far, far away.
That was 1977 but, in 2015, just before its seventh  lm, interest in Star Wars is not slowing down. Now, there is news of a new  lm about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader.
Fans around the world are always waiting for new poster art, new trailers and other information, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst. I dont think any other movie franchise could cause this much excitement.
The latest Star Wars mania started after Disney bought Lucas lm from Star Wars creator, George Lucas, in 2012. After Disney paid $4 billion for Lucas lm, it announced that there would be three more Star Wars  lms  VII, VIII and IX  plus plans for spin-off movies.
They have now announced details of the second spin-off. It is a story about Han Solo, the character played by Harrison Ford in the  rst three  lms. This second new  lm will be released in May 2018.
Before that, they will release Episode VII in December 2015, directed by JJ Abrams and called Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Episode VIII will come out in 2017 and a spin-off called Rogue One will arrive in cinemas in 2016.
Lots of people are very interested in the rumour that Darth Vader, the villain from the original  lms, will reappear in Rogue One. This interest shows the power of Star Wars.
Lucas lm-Disney are creating a cinema universe around Star Wars, with many different characters and stories. They are doing the same thing as the very successful  lms produced by Marvel Studios. Disney also bought them, in 2009.
Disney knows a lot about marketing: Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to make people excited about the new  lm.
There has been much enthusiasm for Star Wars for at least twenty years. This is shown by the huge number of novels, comic books, video games and merchandising that Lucas lm has created.
Michael Rosser, news editor for the magazine Screen International, says this is what makes Star Wars the top  lm franchise. The great thing about the  rst Star Wars  lms was that they created a huge universe of characters and stories, he said.
For years, people have wondered how the different parts of the story  t together. This new  lm goes back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker so it will reconnect with the  rst Star Wars  lm. The prequels did not do that.
Rosser is talking about the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. They were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who becomes Darth Vader. They got quite bad reviews but they made $2.5 billion.
It shows the power of Star Wars  the prequels were disappointing but they still made a lot of money, said Rosser.
The movie studio wants to continue the franchise and make sure new  lms are of good quality. They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots of people are watching  lms at home. But you dont want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone.
Dergarabedian expects big business when The Force Awakens opens at cinemas in December 2015. It should make at least a billion dollars. Star Wars is the ultimate movie franchise.
