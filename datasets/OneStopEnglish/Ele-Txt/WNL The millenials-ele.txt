Elementary
It is no secret that millenials use social media a lot. More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed, almost two thirds say they text while driving and three quarters have created a pro le on a social networking site. But some millenials dont use social media at all. Here are four of them.
Celan Beausoleil, 31, Oakland, California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off relationship with Facebook. She deleted her account recently because the amount of personal information about other people was too much for her.
In my job, I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel too much to go on social media and see every detail of everybodys lives, including people that I dont know very well, she said.
But she loves the way social media connects the world in a unique way. One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and  nish on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said. I used to do that all the time.
Jason Mathias, 26, Baltimore, Maryland One day, I realized: Im spending so much time doing this. I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend this time here and spent it doing something else. What if I was doing other things with these seconds? What would they become? Would I enjoy it?
Mathias had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years but deleted them in November 2012. He quickly forgot that Facebook existed but he can still understand the bene ts of having social media accounts, for example how easy it is to organize large events online.
But now he loves his extra free time. He spends his spare moments at work reading news articles and books. And with no friends to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something he now enjoys.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a private person. So she doesnt like social media much. She has deleted her Twitter account and deleted her Facebook account two years ago when she realized that she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing.
She recently broke up with her partner. The last time she broke up with someone and she was online, it was not nice. One time, I broke up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I thought Oh my gosh, should I change my pro le photo? Should I change my status? And this time I dont have to worry about that, she said.
Hariharan Rajagopalan, 18, Boston, Massachusetts Rajagopalan,a student at Boston College, doesnt see a problem with not using social media. He says that he hasnt seen any effect at this point. His classmates post about parties and events on Facebook but they send him a text message, too, he said.
Rajagopalan has only used social media once: it was the only way to contact his new roommate at college. Before starting his  rst year at college, he joined Facebook to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year.
He still has the account but he says: I dont use it. I dont check it.
