Elementary
Scarlett Johansson is suing a French novelist for 50,000. She says that he wrote things about her personal life that are not true.
La premiere chose quon regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gregoire Delacourt is the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the books main male character thinks she is Johansson. In the novel, the models beauty means that men see her only as a sex object and women are jealous of her. She has many adventures as Johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Johansson does not feel  attered by the best- seller. Her lawyer, Vincent Toledano, told Le Figaro that Delacourts novel illegally used Ms Johanssons name. He has now gone to court because Johansson does not want the book to be translated or to become a  lm.
Delacourt said that he chose to mention Johansson because she is famous for her beauty. He said: I wrote a work of  ction. My character is not Scarlett Johansson.
On French radio, the author recently said the legal action was sad.
Delacourt is one of Frances best-loved authors; his last novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and they are making a  lm of it. But he said he was speechless when he found out Johansson was suing him.
I thought she would ask me to go for a coffee with her. I didnt write a novel about a celebrity, he said. I wrote a real love story about womens beauty, especially interior beauty.
If an author can no longer write about the things that surround us  a brand of beer, a monument, an actor  its going to be dif cult to write  ction.
Im not sure shes read the novel because it hasnt been translated yet.
Emmanuelle Allibert, spokeswoman for publisher JC Latte_s, said taking legal action was crazy. We have never known anything like it. It is very surprising because the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson. It is about a woman who is Scarlett Johanssons double.
The authors legal situation would be easier if he had published the book in the USA and not in France. Lloyd Jassin, a New York lawyer, said that the case would probably not go to court in the United States.
I thought she might send me  owers because the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.
