From glow-in-the-dark trees to underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins, we look at some of the more left eld solutions to help make our cities more livable. City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them. Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily trials that city-dwellers have to deal with. Step forward the inventors. We consider ten of the wackier solutions to making our cities more livable. 
Pop-up parks Todays cities sometimes look like theyre built more for cars than people. The pop-up park is a simple idea. Take an empty car park, a pocketful of change and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park. The PARK(ing) project kicked off as an arts experiment in San Francisco and has since spread across the world. Temporary urban farms and ecology demos are just some of the ideas to have emerged out of the movement, which celebrates a day of action every September.
Subterranean storage Not all urban dwellers are hooked to the car. Bikes are ever more in vogue. The question is: where to keep it safe? Tokyo-based engineering  rm Giken has come up with a concept for a solution: an eco- cycle, anti-seismic underground bicycle park. At just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep enough into the ground to house 204 bikes. Owners can retrieve their bike at the touch of a button, with the automated system delivering it back above ground in around 13 seconds.
Glow-in-the-dark trees When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas baubles and fallen pine needles usually come to mind. Not Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has comes up with a bioluminescent plant. The experimental technology splices DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a jelly sh-type glow. Trials are underway to create an industrial-scale version of the biomimicry-inspired technology that Roosegaarde hopes could one day replace conventional street lighting.
Footfall harvesting Every day, hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. Few probably notice the springiness beneath their feet. Fewer still connect that  ve-millimetre  ex in the rubber surface to the powering of the streetlights above. The paved  ooring is decked with smart tiles that capture the kinetic energy from pedestrians footsteps and convert it into electricity. Pavegen, the UK  rm behind the innovation, has installed a similar system at Londons Heathrow Airport, among other international locations.
Supertrees It had to happen eventually: man-made trees. Singapores Gardens by the Bay has a small copse of them. Up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed supertrees not only have  owers and ferns growing up them but their metallic canopies act to absorb and disperse heat too. Theyre equipped to harvest rainwater, too, as well as provide air ventilation for two climate-controlled biomes (large conservatories, in other words) below. Eleven of the 18 trees also boast solar panels along their branches.
